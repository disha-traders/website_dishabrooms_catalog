Here’s a ready-made prompt you can **copy–paste into Replit AI** 👇

---

**Prompt for Replit AI:**

> You are a senior full-stack Next.js developer helping me build a **production-ready marketing + catalog website** for my manufacturing client.
>
> ---
>
> ## 🏭 Business & Brand
>
> * **Company Name:** Disha Traders
> * **Brand Name:** Alagu Mayil
> * **Location:** Tamil Nadu, India
> * **Business Type:** Manufacturer
> * **Product Lines:**
>
>   * Grass Brooms
>   * Coco Brooms
>   * Yarn Mops
>   * Wipers & Brushes
> * **Tagline:** “All Cleaning Products in One Place – Manufactured with Pride in Tamil Nadu.”
>
> This is my **first customer**, so build it clean, maintainable, and easy to extend.
>
> ---
>
> ## 🎨 Design System
>
> Use this color palette and turn them into CSS variables/tokens:
>
> * Cetacean Blue – `#080A59`  (primary dark background, header/footer)
> * True Blue – `#0261D3`  (primary accent, links, some buttons)
> * Teal Green – `#0CA586`  (accent, success, pill badges)
> * Dark Pastel Green – `#06B029`  (WhatsApp/enquiry buttons)
> * Yellow-Green (Chartreuse) – `#95D426`  (CTA highlight)
> * Gold/Bronze – `#B27F25`  (premium accents, borders)
> * Mud/Brown – `#785748`  (neutral, subtle backgrounds, dividers)
>
> Typography:
>
> * Use a modern, clean sans-serif (e.g., system font stack or Inter).
> * Headings: bold, slightly condensed, strong.
> * Body: 14–16px, readable, good line-height.
>
> Layout:
>
> * Responsive, mobile-first.
> * Max content width ~1100–1200px.
> * Sticky header on top.
> * Generous spacing and subtle shadows for cards.
>
> ---
>
> ## 🧱 Tech Stack & Project Setup
>
> * Use **Next.js 14 App Router**.
> * Use **JavaScript** (not TypeScript).
> * Use **app directory** (`/app`) with `layout.js` and route segments.
> * Use a single global stylesheet (`app/globals.css`) with CSS variables for colors.
> * Organize reusable components under `/components`.
> * This project will be deployed to **Vercel**, so make sure `npm run build` works.
>
> For now:
>
> * Use **static/mock data** for products and settings (read from a local JS/JSON module).
> * But architect it so later we can replace data layer with **Firebase Firestore + Storage** without changing UI components too much.
>

>
> ## 📂 Required Routes & Pages
>
> Build these pages:
>
> 1. `/` – **Home**
> 2. `/products` – **Product Catalog**
> 3. `/about` – **About / Factory**
> 4. `/contact` – **Contact & Distributor Enquiry**
> 5. `/admin` – **Private Admin Panel (for now, local-data based)**
>
> ### 1️⃣ Home (`/`)
>
> Sections:
>
> * **Hero section:**
>
>   * Left:
>
>     * Brand: “Alagu Mayil – Premium Brooms & Cleaning Products”
>     * Text about manufacturing Grass Brooms, Coco Brooms, Yarn Mops, Wipers & Brushes.
>     * Tagline: “All Cleaning Products in One Place – Manufactured with Pride in Tamil Nadu.”
>     * Two buttons:
>
>       * Primary (filled, Yellow-Green): “View Product Catalog” → `/products`
>       * Secondary (outline, Teal Green): “Enquire on WhatsApp” → placeholder link like `https://wa.me/91XXXXXXXXXX?...`
>   * Right:
>
>     * Hero image area placeholder: a collage-style layout (just use a solid background + “Product image coming soon” box or generic broom image placeholder).
>   * Background:
>
>     * Gradient from Cetacean Blue to True Blue with subtle shapes using Teal Green & Gold.
> * **Product Categories section:**
>
>   * Title: “Our Product Range”
>   * 4 category cards: Grass Brooms, Coco Brooms, Yarn Mops, Wipers & Brushes.
>   * Each card: icon/placeholder, 1–2 line description, “View products →” linking to `/products` with category filter (you can implement filter via query param or client-side state).
> * **Why Choose Us section:**
>
>   * 3–4 cards: “Factory-Direct Supply”, “Consistent Quality”, “Bulk & Custom Orders”, “Reliable Packing & Dispatch”.
>   * Use Teal Green & Gold accents for icons/badges.
> * **Ideal For strip:**
>
>   * Horizontal strip listing: Kirana Stores, Supermarkets, Wholesalers, Exporters.
>   * Background with very soft Mud/Brown overlay and light icons.
> * **Bottom CTA:**
>
>   * Text: “Looking for a reliable broom & mop supplier?”
>   * Button: “Share Your Requirement on WhatsApp” (placeholder link).
>
> ### 2️⃣ Products (`/products`) – Catalog
>
> This is the core catalog page.
>
> * Top section:
>
>   * Page title: “Our Products”
>   * Short intro text.
>   * Filter bar:
>
>     * Category dropdown or horizontal pills: [All | Grass Brooms | Coco Brooms | Yarn Mops | Wipers & Brushes]
> * Product grid:
>
>   * Use a **mock `products` array** imported from a separate module, something like:
>
>     ```js
>     export const products = [
>       {
>         id: "am-gb-501",
>         name: "Alagu Mayil Grass Broom 501",
>         category: "Grass Brooms",
>         code: "AM-GB-501",
>         size: "Premium Soft, Long Handle",
>         description: "Durable grass broom ideal for daily household sweeping.",
>         imageUrl: "/images/placeholder-grass-501.jpg"
>       },
>       ...
>     ];
>     ```
>   * Display as cards (2–3 columns on desktop, 1–2 on mobile).
>   * Each card:
>
>     * Product image (use `<img>` with placeholder image from `/public/images` for now).
>     * Name.
>     * Category badge.
>     * Size/variant.
>     * Code (small).
>     * Short description (max 2–3 lines).
>     * “Enquire on WhatsApp” button with pre-filled message containing product name + code.
>
> Styling:
>
> * Card background: white, subtle shadow, rounded corners.
> * Category badge: Teal Green pill with white text.
> * Button: Dark Pastel Green with white text, rounded pill.
>
> ### 3️⃣ About (`/about`)
>
> Sections:
>
> * “About Disha Traders”
>
>   * Short story about being a manufacturer in Tamil Nadu.
> * “Alagu Mayil Brand”
>
>   * Why the name, focus on quality & consistency.
> * “Manufacturing & Quality”
>
>   * Brief points on sourcing material, handcrafting, quality checks.
> * “Production & Supply”
>
>   * Mention serving distributors, retailers, supermarkets, exporters.
>
> Use more earthy tones (Mud/Brown + Gold accents) to give a grounded, factory feel.
>
> ### 4️⃣ Contact (`/contact`)
>
> Split layout (stack on mobile):
>
> * Left: Contact Info (data should come from a central config module)
>
>   * Company: Disha Traders
>   * Brand: Alagu Mayil
>   * Address (text from config)
>   * Phone (from config)
>   * WhatsApp link
>   * Email
>   * Optional map embed placeholder.
> * Right: Distributor/Bulk Enquiry
>
>   * Short text inviting distributors, wholesalers, retailers, supermarkets, exporters.
>   * For v1, just show a list of “Please share these details on WhatsApp:” (Name, Business Name, City/State, Products needed, Approx monthly requirement).
>   * Button: “Send Enquiry on WhatsApp” with pre-filled template message.
>
> The key is to make this page simple, clean, and easy to understand.
>
> ---
>
> ## 🔐 Admin Panel (`/admin`)
>
> This page is **for me only**, not for the client. Implement a basic local-data-based admin UI now, but write it in a way that later we can wire it up to Firebase Firestore + Storage.
>
> ### Access
>
> * Route: `/admin`.
> * Simple password gate:
>
>   * On first load, show a centered password form.
>   * Compare input with an env value like `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` or a hardcoded placeholder for now (we’ll secure it properly later).
>   * If correct, store a flag in `localStorage` or React state for this session.
>
> ### Admin Layout
>
> Use a simple layout with tabs or sections:
>
> 1. **General Settings**
>
>    * Editable fields:
>
>      * Company name
>      * Brand name
>      * Phone number
>      * WhatsApp number
>      * Email
>      * Address text
>    * For now, these should update a local state and write back to a central config object stored in a local JS file or in-memory mock. (Don’t worry about persistence yet; we will replace this with Firestore later.)
>    * This config should be what the public pages use for contact details.
> 2. **Hero Section (optional simple controls)**
>
>    * Fields:
>
>      * Hero title
>      * Hero subtitle
>    * For now, just update local state/config.
> 3. **Products Management**
>
>    * List all products from the same mock `products` data module.
>    * For each product:
>
>      * Show current image thumbnail, name, code, category.
>      * “Edit” button which opens a modal or inline form:
>
>        * Fields: name, code, category (dropdown), size, description.
>        * **Image change:** file input to “upload new image” – for now, you can just simulate/image preview and store the filename/path in local state or config. Later, this will actually upload to Firebase Storage and update Firestore.
>    * Implement the UI structure and handlers even if they just mutate local data in memory for now.
>
> Design:
>
> * Admin UI can be simple, but clean:
>
>   * White cards on light background.
>   * Use the same color system but more muted.
>
> ---
>
> ## 🧩 Data Structure & Code Organization
>
> Create a simple modular structure:
>
> * `/app/layout.js` – global layout, header, footer.
>
> * `/app/page.js` – Home page.
>
> * `/app/products/page.js` – Product catalog page.
>
> * `/app/about/page.js` – About page.
>
> * `/app/contact/page.js` – Contact/Enquiry.
>
> * `/app/admin/page.js` – Admin panel.
>
> * `/components/Header.js`
>
> * `/components/Footer.js`
>
> * `/components/Hero.js` (optional)
>
> * `/components/ProductCard.js`
>
> * `/components/Admin/*` for admin-specific components (forms, lists, etc.).
>
> * `/lib/config.js` – central exported object for:
>
>   * companyName, brandName, phone, whatsappNumber, email, address, heroTitle, heroSubtitle.
>   * For now these can be static JS exports, but admin UI should conceptually read/update these.
>
> * `/lib/products.js` – mock products array used by both public pages and admin.
>
> `app/globals.css`:
>
> * Define root CSS variables for colors.
> * Base styles for body, headings, containers, grid, buttons, tags, etc.
>
> ---
>
> ## 🔧 Requirements & Quality
>
> * Make sure the app runs with:
>
>   * `npm install`
>   * `npm run dev`
>   * `npm run build`
>
> * Keep the code **clean, modular, and easy to read**.
>
> * Use functional components and React hooks.
>
> * No external CSS frameworks (no Tailwind, no Bootstrap) – use plain CSS for now.
>
> * Provide some initial placeholder images in `/public/images` and wire them in `products` data.
>
> * IMPORTANT: design everything with the assumption that later:
>
>   * `config.js` and `products.js` will be replaced by Firebase Firestore queries.
>   * Product images will come from Firebase Storage URLs instead of `/public`.
>
> Please generate:
>
> 1. The full Next.js project structure (files + folders) needed.
> 2. All page components and main UI components.
> 3. Example mock data for products and config.
> 4. Clean, readable CSS in `app/globals.css` using the given color palette.
>
> Focus on **good structure + clean design + easy future extension**.
