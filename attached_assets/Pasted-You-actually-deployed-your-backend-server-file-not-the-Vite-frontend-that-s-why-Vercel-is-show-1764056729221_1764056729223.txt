You actually **deployed your backend server file, not the Vite frontend**, that’s why Vercel is showing that long `server/index-prod.ts` / `dist/index.js` code instead of your catalog UI.

From the log:

```txt
> rest-express@1.0.0 build
> vite build && esbuild server/index-prod.ts ...
...
../dist/public/index.html
```

So:

* Vite is building your **frontend** into `dist/public/…`
* `esbuild` is building an **Express server** into `dist/index.js`
* On Vercel, that server build is what’s being served at `/`, so you just see code.

For this simple catalog website you don’t need the Node/Express server on Vercel at all. Just deploy the **static Vite build**.

## ✅ Fix: Make Vercel deploy only the Vite frontend

### 1. Simplify `package.json` build script (in your GitHub repo)

Open `package.json` and change the scripts to something like:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

* **Remove** the `&& esbuild server/index-prod.ts ...` part from the `build` script.
* Keep all your React/Vite dependencies as they are.

Commit & push this change to GitHub.

### 2. Set correct build settings in Vercel

In your Vercel project:

1. Go to **Settings → Build & Development Settings**.
2. Set **Framework Preset**: `Vite` (or “Other” if Vite not detected, but Vite is best).
3. Set:

   * **Install Command**: `npm install`
   * **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   * **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
     (your log clearly shows `../dist/public/index.html`, so `dist/public` is your final folder)

Save changes.

### 3. Redeploy

* In Vercel → Deployments → click **“Redeploy”** (or push any new commit to GitHub).
* After deploy finishes, open:

`https://website-dishabrooms-catalog.vercel.app`

Now Vercel will serve the **built index.html from `dist/public`**, and you should see your Disha Brooms catalog UI instead of raw server code.

---

### If you *do* need a backend later

You can:

* Host backend (Express / REST API) separately on **Render / Railway / Replit**, and
* Keep Vercel **only for the frontend**.

But for this catalog site, static Vite on Vercel is perfect and free.
