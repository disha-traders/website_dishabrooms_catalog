3️⃣ Replit AI Prompt (copy–paste)
You are a senior full-stack web developer and UI designer. Improve and finalize the ADMIN experience for this Disha Traders catalog site.

Context:
- Tech: React + Vite (or Next-like SPA) using Firebase (Firestore + Storage) with VITE_FIREBASE_* env vars.
- Brand colors: Cetacean Blue (#080A59), True Blue (#0261D3), Teal Green (#0CA586), Dark Pastel Green (#06B029), Yellow-Green (#95D426), Gold (#B27F25), Mud Brown (#785748).
- Admin route: /admin with a simple password gate.

### GOAL
Make /admin a clean, functional dashboard with:
1) Products management (CRUD + image upload)
2) General Settings (company/contact info)
using Firestore and Storage.

---

### 1. Layout & Theme
Implement:
- Top header bar:
  - Left: “Disha Traders Admin”
  - Right: “View Site” link and “Logout” button
  - Background: Cetacean Blue, white text.
- Tabbed navigation below header:
  - Tabs: [Products] [General Settings]
  - Active tab with True Blue bottom border and bold label.
- Page background: light grey (#F5F5F7).
- Use white cards with rounded corners and soft shadow for content sections.

---

### 2. Products Tab (Firestore: `products` collection)
Requirements:
- Load products from Firestore collection `products`.
- Show list of product rows:
  - Thumbnail image
  - Name
  - Code
  - Category
  - Edit and Delete buttons on the right.
- Always show a visible “+ Add Product” primary button at the top-right of the Products tab.

Add/Edit dialog:
- Fields: name, code, category (dropdown: Grass Brooms, Coco Brooms, Yarn Mops, Wipers & Brushes), size, description.
- Image upload:
  - Upload to Firebase Storage under `product-images/`.
  - Get public URL and store in `imageUrl`.
- On Save:
  - For new items: use `addDoc` to Firestore.
  - For existing: use `updateDoc`.
  - Update local state so the list refreshes without page reload.
- On Delete:
  - Confirm, then `deleteDoc` from Firestore and update local state.

Handle cases:
- If there are zero products, show an empty state message (“No products yet”) plus the Add Product button.
- If Firestore read fails, log the error to console and show a simple error message instead of being stuck on “Loading…”.

---

### 3. General Settings Tab (Firestore: `settings/dishaTraders`)
Implement a settings form in a single card:
- Fields:
  - companyName
  - brandName
  - phone
  - whatsapp
  - email
  - address (textarea)
- On initial load:
  - Read document `settings/dishaTraders` from Firestore.
  - Populate the form; if the doc doesn’t exist, use reasonable defaults.

On Save:
- Use `setDoc(doc(db, "settings", "dishaTraders"), {...fields}, { merge: true })`.
- Show a small inline success message (“Settings saved”) and log success to console.
- On error, show an error message and log the error.

Ensure the existing site config hook (useConfig or similar) reads from this document so changes reflect on Home, Contact, and Footer.

---

### 4. Code Quality
- Keep components modular: separate Products admin, Settings admin, and layout/header into their own components.
- Use hooks for Firebase data (e.g., useProductsAdmin, useSettingsAdmin) to keep UI components clean.
- Add basic loading and error states for both tabs.

Do not redesign the public site; focus only on making /admin robust, clean, and fully wired to Firestore/Storage with the theme above.
