Thanks — the screenshots are helpful. The Vercel logs in your images show the build finished with warnings (chunk size, deprecation), not an obvious fatal error — so the problem is likely a configuration (wrong build/output settings), a runtime error in the produced site, or the build output being placed in the wrong directory.

To help you get this visible quickly, try the checklist & troubleshooting steps below. If you want, paste your package.json (or give me permission to view the repo) and I’ll inspect it and the Vercel settings for you.

Quick checklist (most common causes)
- Confirm framework / build settings in Vercel:
  - In your Vercel project → Settings → General → Build & Output Settings:
    - Framework Preset should match your project (Next.js, Create React App, Vite, etc.)
    - Build Command: usually npm run build (or yarn build)
    - Output Directory: depends on framework:
      - Create React App → build
      - Vite → dist
      - Next.js → leave output dir empty (Vercel handles Next.js)
      - SvelteKit → depends on adapter (often a serverless adapter, not a static output)
- Ensure package.json has the build script that the Build Command calls:
  - Example: "scripts": { "build": "react-scripts build" } or "build": "vite build" or "next build"
- If your app is a SPA and you get 404s on client routes, add a rewrite to index.html (or use Vercel’s SPA settings).
- Environment variables: if the app depends on env vars, set them in Vercel (Project → Settings → Environment Variables).
- Check the “Visit” link (in the deployment page) — if it loads a blank page, open DevTools → Console/Network to see errors (404 for index, JS exceptions, missing assets).

What to inspect in the Vercel UI / logs
1. Open the same Deployment page and scroll the Build Logs to top — verify there’s no earlier error lines (not only selected lines).
2. Look at the “Source” and “Framework Preset” area on the project settings — Vercel auto-detect sometimes picks wrong preset.
3. Click the Visit button and open browser DevTools:
   - Network tab: is index.html returned (200)? Or do assets 404?
   - Console tab: any runtime JS errors?
4. Check the “Resources” or “Functions” tab in Vercel if you expect serverless functions — errors there can break things.

Useful local checks
- Run locally:
  - npm install
  - npm run build
- Then preview:
  - For CRA/Vite: npx serve build  (or serve dist)
  - For Next.js: npm run start (after next build + next start)
- If local build fails, the same error will surface and you can fix it before redeploy.

Common fixes by framework
- Create React App:
  - Build command: npm run build
  - Output directory: build
  - If using client-side routing, add vercel.json or allow rewriting to index.html:
    Example vercel.json:
    {
      "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
    }
- Vite:
  - Build command: npm run build
  - Output dir: dist
- Next.js:
  - Use Next.js framework preset (no output dir). Ensure package.json scripts contain next build and next start.
  - If you used next export, ensure output is exported to out and set Output Directory to out.
- SvelteKit:
  - Ensure SvelteKit adapter (e.g., adapter-vercel) is configured and built properly — otherwise Vercel won't serve it.

Address the warnings in your logs
- Chunk-size warnings and deprecation notices are usually not fatal. They won’t prevent visibility but you can address them later by code-splitting or updating dependencies.

If the deployment shows Ready but the site is blank or 404
- Most likely root cause: Output directory mismatch — Vercel completed a build but didn’t find the produced static files at the path you specified.
- Verify the folder produced by npm run build and set that as Output Directory in Vercel.

If you see runtime JS errors on Visit
- Copy the first red error from the browser console and paste it here; it will tell us what’s failing.

If you want me to look through your repo
- Share package.json (paste contents here) and the Vercel deploy URL (the visit link), or let me run a quick repo check — I can then give exact changes (e.g., the correct Output Directory or a vercel.json).

Next step I recommend
1. Open Vercel Project Settings → Build & Output and confirm Build Command and Output Directory match your project type.
2. Run npm run build locally and confirm what folder is generated.
3. If after that you still can’t see it, paste your package.json and the deployment Visit URL and I’ll inspect and give exact config to change.

Tell me:
- What framework did you use (React, Next.js, Vite, SvelteKit, etc.)?
- What happens when you open the Visit link — blank page, 404, or an error message?
- Paste your package.json (or give repo access) and I’ll give the exact Vercel settings you need.
