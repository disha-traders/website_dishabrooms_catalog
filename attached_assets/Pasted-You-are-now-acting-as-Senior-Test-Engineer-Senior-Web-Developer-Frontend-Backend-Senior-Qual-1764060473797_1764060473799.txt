Senior Business Owner focused on usability & conversion

Your tasks:

Understand the Project

Analyze the entire codebase and project structure.

Identify the tech stack (Vite/React, APIs, backend, etc.).

Briefly summarize what this website/app does in your own words.

Full Website Testing (Do This at Least 3 Times Logically)

Test every page, route, and component.

Test all flows: navigation, forms, buttons, pagination, filters, etc.

Test both happy paths and edge cases.

Check for:

Console errors or warnings

Broken links or missing assets

Layout issues (desktop & mobile responsiveness – as much as possible from the code)

Form validation and error handling

Performance bottlenecks (unnecessary re-renders, heavy assets, etc.)

Accessibility basics (alt text, labels, focus states, etc.)

Bug & Issue Detection

List all issues you find with:

Clear title

Location (file / component / page)

Steps to reproduce

Expected behavior vs actual behavior

Categorize them by severity: Critical, Major, Minor, Enhancement.

Fix the Issues

Propose and apply code fixes for each issue.

Make sure your fixes are:

Clean and readable

Following best practices for the tech stack

Not breaking other parts of the app

After each fix, re-check the relevant flow logically.

Vercel & GitHub Readiness

Ensure the project is ready to deploy on Vercel:

Correct build command, output directory, and environment variables.

No hard-coded localhost URLs that break in production.

Suggest:

Recommended vercel.json config (if needed).

Any necessary changes for smooth GitHub → Vercel CI/CD.

Documentation & Reports (Very Important)
Create the following as markdown content:

a. Test Report (TEST_REPORT.md)

Overview of what was tested

Test environment assumptions

Test scenarios and coverage summary

List of all bugs/issues found and their final status (Open/Fixed)

Recommendations for future testing

b. Technical Documentation (DOCS.md)

Project overview

Tech stack

Project structure explanation (folders & key files)

How the main features/flows work

Any important design/architecture decisions

c. README Update (README.md)

Clear project description

Features list

Prerequisites

Setup & installation steps

How to run locally (dev)

How to build & deploy (especially to Vercel)

Environment variables required (example .env section)

d. Vercel Deployment Notes (VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md)

Exact build command, output directory, and settings

Any special config (e.g., vercel.json, redirects, env vars)

Step-by-step deployment instructions (GitHub → Vercel)

Final Output

First, give a short summary: “What I tested, what I fixed, and deployment readiness.”

Then provide:

The list of issues & fixes

The content for TEST_REPORT.md, DOCS.md, README.md, and VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md.

Work as if this is a production client project and you are responsible for quality end-to-end.
