You are a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Build Architect.

Before making any changes, analyze and clearly ANSWER the following questions
about the current project. Do NOT refactor or modify code yet.

=== ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING ===

1. Where is the TRUE application entry point?
   - Is index.html at repo root or inside /client?
   - Which file Vite actually uses as entry?

2. Is this repository intended to be:
   a) Public website only
   b) Admin dashboard only
   c) Combined public + admin app
   d) Transitional / experimental setup

3. What is the CURRENT Vite root?
   - Is it configured via vite.config.ts?
   - Or is Vercel assuming repo root?

=== BUILD & DEPLOYMENT ===

4. Why is Vercel running:
   `npx vite build -c vite.vercel.config.ts`?
   - Where is this command defined?
   - vercel.json?
   - Project settings?
   - package.json?
   - Replit config?

5. Does `vite.vercel.config.ts` exist?
   - If not, who referenced it and why?

6. What is the expected build output?
   - dist/
   - build/
   - client/dist/

7. Is the admin dashboard REQUIRED in production
   or can it be isolated to a subdomain?

=== CODE OWNERSHIP & INTENT ===

8. Which parts of the app are PUBLIC?
   - Home
   - Products
   - Blogs

9. Which parts are ADMIN-only?
   - /admin route
   - CRUD
   - Firebase writes
   - PDF generation

10. Is Firebase meant to be:
    - Required in production
    - Optional (fallback to localStorage)
    - Admin-only

=== SAFETY & RISK ===

11. What breaks if we:
    a) Separate admin into another project
    b) Keep admin and public together
    c) Remove custom Vite configs

12. Which files MUST NOT be deleted
    because business logic depends on them?

=== FINAL CONFIRMATION ===

13. Based on current code,
    which deployment model is SAFEST?

    - Single repo, single Vercel project
    - Two repos, two Vercel projects
    - Public static + admin Vite app

Answer clearly with reasoning for each.
