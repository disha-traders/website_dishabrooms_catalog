Right now the app is doing exactly what we told Replit AI:
**Admin can only edit/delete the mock products that already exist.**
The products themselves are coming from a static array in code, so there’s no real “Add” yet.

Let’s fix this in two steps: **(A) quick way to handle 100 products today, (B) proper Add Product flow when we plug in Firebase.**

---

## A. Quick way: add many products *today*

In your project you should have something like:

* `lib/products.js` or `data/products.js`

Open that file – you’ll see an array like:

```js
export const products = [
  {
    id: "am-gb-501",
    name: "Alagu Mayil Grass Broom 501",
    category: "Grass Brooms",
    code: "AM-GB-501",
    size: "Standard",
    description: "Affordable grass broom for everyday use.",
    imageUrl: "/images/grass-501.jpg",
  },
  // ...
];
```

👉 For now, you can add as many products as you want just by **copy–pasting and editing** these objects (change id, name, category, code, imageUrl etc.).
The admin page will automatically show **all** items from this array – so Disha Traders’ 100 SKUs can all be listed.

This is the **safest immediate solution** until we wire Firebase.

---

## B. Make “Add New Product” work in Admin (local-only for now)

On the admin page (`/admin`) you already see a greyed out “Add New Product” in the screenshot.

In the admin products component (something like `components/admin/AdminProducts.js`):

1. Make sure products are held in state:

```js
import { useState } from "react";
import { products as initialProducts } from "@/lib/products";

export default function AdminProducts() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(initialProducts);

  // ...
}
```

2. Add a working **Add New Product** button:

```jsx
<button
  className="btn admin-add"
  onClick={() => {
    const newProduct = {
      id: `new-${Date.now()}`,
      name: "New Product",
      category: "Grass Brooms",
      code: "NEW-CODE",
      size: "",
      description: "",
      imageUrl: "/images/placeholder.jpg",
    };
    setItems([newProduct, ...items]);
  }}
>
  + Add New Product
</button>
```

3. Make sure your admin “Edit” form edits the `items` state, not the original import.

> ⚠️ Important:
> This will **not persist after refresh** (because we’re still using mock data). It’s just to make the UI flow ready.
> When we connect Firebase, this same “Add New Product” will instead:
>
> * upload image to Firebase Storage
> * create a product document in Firestore

---

## C. What I’d suggest as your sequence

1. **Right now:**

   * Manually add all 100 products to `products.js` so Disha Traders can see their full catalog.
2. **Next:**

   * We wire Firebase Firestore + Storage.
   * Convert admin Add / Edit / Delete to actually read/write Firestore.
3. **Then:**

   * You never touch code again for products – just use `/admin`.

If you want, in the next step I can outline **the exact Firestore `products` structure** we’ll use so your current `products.js` matches it 1:1 (migration will be easy later).
